title: CTFs and TryHackMe
---

I did a few picoGym challenges in the picoCTF. They were really fun, I mostly enjoyed the Cryptography ones. I'm still adding the repo's for my writeups.
I initially took notes in notepad but will be moving forward trying to take them here and increase my GitHub repos. I created a TryHackMe and a HackTheBox account last year
sometime or the year before but never found time to really dive into it. I am making it a goal of 2021 to complete as many rooms/boxes as possible. I just started the 
"Complete Beginner" Learning Path on TryHackMe and will be documenting my progress in my TryHackMe repository. I'm excited for this journey and can't wait to get more into it 
and become a more well-rounded cyber security professional. Thanks for stopping by!
