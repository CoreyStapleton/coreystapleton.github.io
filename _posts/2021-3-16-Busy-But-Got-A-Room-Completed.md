title: Started Linux Funadmentals on TryHackMe and picoCTF Event
---

I started the Linux Fundamentals portion of the Complete Beginner Learning Path on THM today. I was super busy at work, so did most of it during lunch hour.
I took Linux Admin courses during undergrad and have a pretty solid foundation with Linux distros but it is always good to touch up on those skills. There
may be something that I missed or just plain forgot. I'm really loving the THM platform. The UI is very well put together for my liking and I can navigate
the rooms with ease. I like how they have a embeded video that you can follow along with when completing some rooms. I'm sure this will disappear when I get
to more challenging rooms.

picoCTF started today and I'm super excited to start that event. Our team name is "RiverR4tz and consists of myself and 3 other team members as of right now, 
we may have another join. The more the merrier! I will be creating a separate repo with write ups for that. I did some challenges in the picoGym, they were fun. 
I have downloaded the picoCTF pdfs and began to read those to better understand the differnt categories: General Skills, Cryptography, Web Exploitation, 
Forensics, Binary Exploitation and Reversing.

Going to keep adding to this blog to document my progress in learning more and challenging myself daily to become a better security professional.

As always, thanks for stopping by.
