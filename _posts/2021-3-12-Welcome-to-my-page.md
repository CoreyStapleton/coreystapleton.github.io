This is my first blog post on my GitHub page. I'm very new to GitHub and fairly new to the Information Security field. I found this repo, jekyll-now, to create my blog.
I've seen a lot of other users utilizing it. I'm excited to start blogging my CTF events and other accomplishments like completed projects and such. Thanks for stopping by!
