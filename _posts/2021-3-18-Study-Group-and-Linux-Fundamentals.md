title: Sec+ Study Group Lead and THM Linux Fundamentals
---

The Sec+ Study Group moderator in the Battleship discord reached out and asked if I would host the meeting last night. I immediately steppd up to the challenge. I was the team
lead and certified trainger at my old job, so this was nothing new. I'm used to leading trainings and helping others learn. I love to teach and enjoy learning myself. I recently
passed the CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ exam and the information was still fresh in my mind. I enjoy helping people and was eager to answer the questions of my peers who were 
still studying. We had a hiccup or two, the voice channel is set "push-to-talk", and there are a few people new to discord. We got those worked out and the questions started 
coming in. I was knocking them out of the park left and right, in my opinion, I probably sounded like a rambling idiot to them though. I was able to clear the muddy waters 
for most and give advice as best I could without giving information specifics regarding the actual exam. I really enjoy flash cards, not the Anki digital ones, but hard-coded, 
hand writtend flash cards. I tend to learn best when I write it down in my own style and can look at it whenever I need. I feel like I helped some people out and that makes 
me feel good.

I also got Linux Fundamentsa Part 1 - 3 completed and actually subscribed to TryHackMe for one month. I'm currently doing the "Linux Challenges" and am currently on Task 5. This
task covers SQL, FTP, Groups and RDP. I really enjoy learning the syntax of all the different commands and how to pipe them together. I learned a new one today, "2>/dev/null" 
this redirects any standard errors to the /dev/null device. The null device discards all data written to it. 1>/dev/null is for standard output and 2>/dev/null is for standard
error. I'm going to keep grinding out these rooms and complete as many "Easy" ones as possible. I really want to get into the Offensive and Defensive Learning Paths.

As always, thanks for stopping by.
