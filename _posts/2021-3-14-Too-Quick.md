The weekend flew by and I was unable to finish anymore NahamCo2021 CTF challenges. I did as many as I could but decided to begin TryHackMe. I'm hoping this will better prepare
me for CTF events and potential employment opportunitites. I also looked more into picoCTF and the resources they have available. I will look at their primer blog and some of their
writeups for General Skills, Cryptography, Web Exploitation, Forensics, Binary Exploitation and Reversing. A friend of mine told me about a Discord, DeadPixelSec, and I've been 
posting in there and began making some connections. I grouped up with a team to compete in the Cyber Apocalypse 2021 event, team name is "MyDataBeWildin".

I think this year is going to bring a ton of change and I'm excited for what the future will bring!
