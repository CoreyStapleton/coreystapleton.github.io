title: Vacation and Some Time Off
---

I have not posted in a while. I took some time off for Spring Break with the kids and went camping for a few days. It felt good to get off the grid for a bit.
Lost my streak on TryHackMe but that is okay. I can get right back on track and start completing rooms once more. I read a post on LinkedIn from a recruiter that they don't
care about TryHackMe or HackTheBox because "it does not teach you real skills since there is a walkthrough". I found this to be a bit discouraging but then remembered, we all
had some sort of "walkthrough" when learning basic skills like: reading/writing, arithmetic, heck even learning to walk. I had all sorts of guidance growing up and 
it's up to me to keep honing those skills and make them stronger qualities as an cybersecurity professional. 

Never stop learning, never stop trying to become a better person/professional. As always, thanks for stopping by.
