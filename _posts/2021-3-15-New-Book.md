I got a new book today, "The Pentester BluePrint: Starting a Career as an Ethical Hacker" by Phillip L. Wylie and Kim Crawley. I've been wanting to get this book for quite some
time. It's been in my "Save For Later" cart on Amazon and I finally got it. The back cover says "Perfect for IT workers and entry-level information security professionals, The
Pentester BluePrint also belongs on the bookshelves of anyone seeking to transition to the exciting and in-demand field of penetration testing." Seems to be right up my avenue
and I can't wait to start reading this.
