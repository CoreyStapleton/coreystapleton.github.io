This is my first blog post on my GitHub page. I'm very new to GitHub and fairly new to the Information Security field. I found this repo, jekyll-now, to create my blog.
I've seen a lot of other users utilizing it. I'm excited to start blogging my CTF events and other accomplishments like completed projects and such. Thanks for stopping by!

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
